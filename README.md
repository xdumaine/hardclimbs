HardClimbs.info
==========

HardClimbs.info is a collaborative effort to create an online resource which catalogs the world's hardest rock climbs.  This repository is the home of the site's source code with the site itself being deployed on Heroku.

If you'd like to help contribute, feel free to fork this repo and make changes.  If you have an idea for something new or a big change to existing functionality it's best to open an issue first so that the idea can be reviewed before you spend a lot of time working on something that doesn't fit with the vision for hte site.

You will need to use PostgreSQL to do your local development.  The code as it exists today is still very much beta and needs some refinement.  I will be adding bugs and feature requests to the Issues list on this repo in the coming days to help guide some of the work that needs to be done.
