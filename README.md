HardClimbs.info
==========

HardClimbs.info is a collaborative effort to create an online resource which catalogs the world's hardest rock climbs.  This repository is the home of the site's source code with the site itself being deployed on Heroku.

If you'd like to help contribute, feel free to fork this repo and make changes.  The code as it exists today is still very much beta and needs some refinement.  I will be adding bugs and feature requests to the Issues list on this repo in the coming days to help guide some of the work that needs to be done.

Site dependencies include but are not limited to:
* Twitter Bootstrap 2.3 - http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/
* Rails 3.2.13
* Ruby 2.0
* Twitter Typeahead - https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/
* Hogan.js - http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/
* Chosen - http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
* jVectorMap - http://jvectormap.com/
